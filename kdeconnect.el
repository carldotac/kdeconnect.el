;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides helper functions to use the command line
;; version of KDE Connect, a bridge between Android devices and
;; computers, without leaving the comfort of Emacs.  It requires KDE
;; Connect on your computer(s) and Android device(s).  KDE Connect
;; currently requires Linux on the desktop, but does not require
;; KDE.
